<h3 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm <i>Remy!</i></h3>

---

I'm a doctoral candidate in physics at the ðŸŒ´ University of Hawai'i ðŸŒ´ where I use _radio-frequency (RF)_ and _microwave systems_ to detect high-energy particles, including:

+ Searching for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos in the Antarctic ice with the [ANITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Impulsive_Transient_Antenna) and [PUEO](https://pueo.space/) experiments.
+ Measuring particles with picosecond timing precision at next generation colliders with [ACE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01798.pdf).
+ Developing high-performance particle cascade simulations with [CORSIKA 8](https://gitlab.ikp.kit.edu/AirShowerPhysics/corsika).

If you are interested in any of my science work, see my [science website](https://remyprechelt.xyz/). More generally, I'm a big advocate for the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language, open-source and reproducible science, and alternative hardware description languages (HDLs) like [Clash](https://clash-lang.org/).
